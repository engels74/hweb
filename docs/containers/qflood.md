!!! question "What is this?"

    This is a fork of Hotio's [rflood](https://hotio.dev/containers/rflood) Docker image, that uses qBittorrent instead of rtorrent. The qflood image has both "releases" and "nightly support". The included [qBittorrent](https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static) uses libtorrent v2.x.

???+ info "What is nightly?"

    Nightly means it updates automatically after a successful run of [this workflow file](https://github.com/jesec/flood/actions/workflows/publish-rolling.yml). This means that whenever the official flood repository receives a push commit, this docker image should automatically be updated. All thanks to hotio's brilliant setup.

## Starting the container

=== "cli"

    ```shell linenums="1"
    docker run --rm \
        --name qflood \
        -p 8080:8080 \
        -p 3000:3000 \
        -e PUID=1000 \
        -e PGID=1000 \
        -e UMASK=002 \
        -e TZ="Etc/UTC" \
        -e LIBTORRENT="v2" \
        -e FLOOD_AUTH="true" \
        -e ARGS="" \
        -e FLOOD_ARGS="" \
        -v /<host_folder_config>:/config \
        -v /<host_folder_data>:/data \
        ghcr.io/engels74/qflood
    ```

=== "compose"

    ```yaml linenums="1"
    services:
      qflood:
        container_name: qflood
        image: ghcr.io/engels74/qflood
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"
          - "3000:3000"
        environment:
          - PUID=1000
          - PGID=1000
          - UMASK=002
          - TZ=Etc/UTC
          - LIBTORRENT=v2
          - FLOOD_AUTH=true
          - ARGS
          - FLOOD_ARGS
        volumes:
          - /<host_folder_config>:/config
          - /<host_folder_data>:/data
    ```

## Changing the WebUI port

Under certain circumstances it's required to run the WebUI on a different internal port, you can do that by modifying the environment variable `WEBUI_PORTS` accordingly. It should be in the format `xxxx/tcp,xxxx/udp`, take a look at the default with `docker logs` (variable is printed at container start) or `docker inspect`.
