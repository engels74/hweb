!!! question "What is this?"

    This is a fork of Hotio's Docker image. It's used for my other Docker images. It's basically the same as Hotio's except that it's tailored to my containers.

## Starting the container

=== "cli"

    ```shell linenums="1"
    docker run --rm \
        --name base-image \
        -e PUID=1000 \
        -e PGID=1000 \
        -e UMASK=002 \
        -e TZ="Etc/UTC" \
        -v /<host_folder_config>:/config \
        ghcr.io/engels74/base-image:alpinevpn
    ```

=== "compose"

    ```yaml linenums="1"
    services:
      base-image:
        container_name: base-image
        image: ghcr.io/engels74/base-image:alpinevpn
        environment:
          - PUID=1000
          - PGID=1000
          - UMASK=002
          - TZ=Etc/UTC
        volumes:
          - /<host_folder_config>:/config
    ```

This image is the base-image image for all other application images, however it can be used as a standalone VPN image for other images to attach to.
