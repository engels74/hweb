## Welcome

This is a fork of hotio's [official website](https://hotio.dev). It's main purpose is to show the few amounts of containers, that I forked myself off of hotio's deprecated projects. It's mainly for personal use, but I made the website available for documentation, for anyone who might stumble upon the forked containers.

Most images come with docker cli or compose examples. 

If you've got any questions, feel free to create an issue on the GitHub repository for the specific container you need help with.
