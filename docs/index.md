## Welcome

This is a fork of hotio's [official website](https://hotio.dev). It's main purpose is to show the few amounts of containers, that I forked myself off of hotio's deprecated projects. It's mainly for personal use, but I made the website available for documentation, for anyone who might stumble upon the forked containers.

Most images come with docker cli or compose examples. If you've got any questions or think you've found a bug in one of the images, please create a new issue on the GitHub repository for that specific container.

If you enjoy the images don't forget to go give some stars:
